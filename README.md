# text_analyzer

The basic task in sentiment analysis is classifying the polarity of the sentence -whether expressed opinion in the sentence is positive, negative, and neutral.
This project of sentiment analysis uses Twitter API to fetch the tweets from twitter and use opinion mining and Natural language processing, text analysis to predict the polarity.
For predicting the polarity of a text is tokenized into words and the words are identified as positive /negative from different dictionaries then calculating overall polarity of the sentence or text. Since the language is ambiguous the accuracy of the analysis is not very high but by tuning the model using different data cleaning or data transformation technique the accuracy can be increased.
After calculating the polarity of each tweet the project plot statistics to show that portion of tweets is positive, negative or neutral.
The project can run on both console and webpage .For the project to run on webpage we use Django.
